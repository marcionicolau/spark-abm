		<title>Installation of SPARK-PL</title>
		<para>
			SPARK is a Java library for developing agent based models
			in Java. SPARK-PL is a special programming language
			which greatly facilitate the model developing process.
			Each SPARK-PL distribution includes a copy of the latest
			SPARK library along with all necessary tools to implement
			and run your own SPARK models.
		</para>
		<para>
			First of all, you need to obtain a copy of SPARK-PL.
			It can be downloaded from the official SPARK site
			at
			<link xlink:href="http://www.pitt.edu/~cirm/spark">
				http://www.pitt.edu/~cirm/spark
			</link>
			in the Download section. There you need to select the latest version of
			a SPARK-PL distribution for your operation system. Also
			you can download a universal distribution which works
			on any platform. This universal distribution does not support
			advanced graphical features of SPARK which are not essential
			for model developing.
		</para>
		<para>  
			You don't need to get anything
			else except Java runtime of version 1.5 or higher. 
			You can test whether you have Java or not by
			visiting the Web page
			<link xlink:href="http://java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml">
				http://java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml
			</link>
		</para>
		<para>
			The installation process of SPARK-PL itself is very simple.
			Extract the distribution archive into any folder on your computer
			and you are done. To start SPARK, open
			'SPARK Manager.jar' in Explorer, Finder, or another
			file manager.
		</para>

		<title>SPARK GUI</title>
		<para>
			Before creating your own model, it is a good idea
			to look at sample models. After running 'SPARK Manager.jar',
			click 'Open project...' in the 'File' menu. Go to the 'samples'
			folder, select any folder there, and open an xml file inside
			the selected folder. Now click the 'Start' button and the SPARK
			user interface will appear with the selected model (here a screenshot
			of Worms model is shown).

			</figure>
			
			The SPARK user interface consists of several windows. The main window with
			simulation control elements is always shown. Other windows are
			parameters, charts, additional views, model methods, and model data.
			Some types of windows (charts, additional views) can be created directly
			from the user interface. Other windows (parameters, methods, data) only appear if the
			corresponding model has special elements.  
		</para>
		
		<para>
			You can move and resize windows. Closing any window except the main window will hide
			the corresponding window. It can later be shown again by selecting its name in the
			Window menu. Closing the main window will stop the simulation and exit the user
			interface. Positions, sizes, and visibility of all windows are saved automatically when
			the interface is closed. Next time the same model is run, all windows will be restored
			to their saved positions.

		<para>
			The main window contains the following elements: the main menu bar, the simulation control panel,
			a graphical view control panel, a graphical view panel.

			</figure>
			
		<para>
			The left most label shows the number of simulation ticks. In SPARK, simulation time
			is measured in simulation steps, ticks. Next is 'Start' button which starts a simulation.
			When this button is clicked, then it will become 'Pause' button which
			can pause an active simulation process.
			The button 'Setup' stops a simulation and reinitializes a loaded model.
			Also it resets all information gathered during the previous
			simulation process. The center slider controls the simulation
			speed. This slider specifies the amount of skipped frames and simulation delays. 
			The right most slider also controls the simulation speed in terms of
			simulation frequency. The precise meaning of the simulation speed and these sliders is
			given below.
		</para>  
			
		<para>
			In SPARK, simulation and visualization processes are parallel. When the simulation speed is at the Normal position,
			then the simulation process runs as fast as possible meanwhile visualization process tries
			to visualize as much as it can. If the simulation process is faster than visualization, then
			some frames will be skipped automatically. If the simulation speed is set to faster values
			(on the left from the Normal position), then several frames will be always skipped (the label Fast
			corresponds to 100 skipped frames). Slower values of the simulation speed affect the simulation process
			by inserting a short delay after each simulation step. The length of this delay is constant.
		</para>
		<para>
			The frequency slider (the right most one) can be only used to slow down the simulation process.
			The purpose of this control is to fix the simulation frequency rate. The labels on the slider
			correspond to desired frequency rates. 0 means that the frequency rate is not fixed. The frequency
			rate is not guaranteed for slow simulations.

			<para>
				Open. Opens a SPARK model directly form the SPARK user interface.
				Warning: if you want to open a SPARK model directly from the user interface,
				then do not confuse a SPARK project description file and a SPARK model descriptioin
				file which both have the xml extension. Usually, a SPARK project description file
				is located in the root folder of a SPARK project, meanwhile a SPARK model description
				file is located in project's output folder (which is usually called 'output').
			</para>
			<para>
				Close. Closes a loaded model. Not really useful.
			</para>
			<para>
				Exit. Closes the SPARK user interface. All interface information is
				automatically saved for the currently open model.
			</para>
			<para>
				Below the 'Exit' item, names of recently open models are shown. Choosing one of them
				will close the loaded model and open the selected one.
			</para>
			<para>
				Preferences. Opens the SPARK preferences dialog.

				In the first tab, the visualization engine can be selected.
				Note that JOGL can be selected only if you are using a version
				of SPARK specific for your operation system (not a universal version).
			</para>
			<para>
				In the second tab, the number of remembered recently open models can be specified.
			</para>
			<para>
				The third tab specifies a directory where bitmap fonts can be found.
				This is used in JOGL rendering mode and is a subject of another tutorial.

				The check box and the next number field set the random generator seed
				for the next simulation. If the check box is not selected, then
				the seed in the number field is used for initializing the random number
				generator for the next simulation. Different simulation processes with
				the same simulation seed will give the same outcome.  
			</para>
			<para>
				Last two parameters (Observer name and Execution mode) are experimental. It is not
				recommended to change them from the default values.
			</para>
			<para>
				Data layer properties. Opens the dialog for setting visualization properties of 
				data layers.
			</para>
			<para>
				Batch run. Opens the dialog for starting a batch run process.
			</para>
		</sect3>
		
		<sect3>
			<title>Window</title>
		
				
		<para>
			The next menu is 'Options' menu.
			The first item there is 'Graphics'. If you select this
			item, then you get the following window
			
			<figure>
				<title>Graphics options</title>
				<mediaobject>
					<imageobject>
						<imagedata align="left" format="PNG" width = "4in"
							fileref="images/GraphicsOptions.png" />
					</imageobject>
				</mediaobject>
			</figure>
			
			Here you can select a library which will be used for performing
			all visualization operations. OpenGL is a fast library, but
			Java2D is more robust. If you have an universal SPARK-PL distribution,
			then you cannot select OpenGL option here (in fact, you can do this,
			but you get an error). If you have another version of SPARK-PL
			and have some problems with graphics or get some errors referring
			to 'jogl', then select Java2d here. In any case, after changing
			a graphic library, you need to close the SPARK user interface and
			run it again.
		</para>
		<para>
			The next item in the 'Options' menu is 'Batch Run Parameters'.
			It is used for running the same model several times automatically
			(see below about saving simulation data for more details).
			The last item is 'Data Layer Parameters'.
			
			<figure>
				<title>Data layers parameters</title>

							fileref="images/WormsDatalayerParameters.png" />
					</imageobject>
				</mediaobject>
			</figure>
			
			Here you can specify the visualization properties of data layers
			(whatever they are). You can change two values and colors
			associated with that values. The first value corresponds to
			the minimum value of a data layer and the second value corresponds
			to the maximum value of a data layer. These values can be arbitrary,
			they do not affect data layers but only used for their visualization.
			If you want to get exact minimum and maximum values for a data layer,
			then click 'Normalize' button.
		</para>
		<para>
			The next menu is 'Window' menu. The first item 'New view'
			creates a new 'View' window where a simulation process
			is visualized. In SPARK you can have several visualization
			windows with different visualization parameters. Next items in
			the 'Window' menu contain the names of all open windows. A check
			box on the left for each window indicates whether the window is
			visible or not. If you click on a window name, then you either
			make it visible or hide depending on its current state.
		</para>
		<para>
			The last menu 'Help' contains information about SPARK.

				It contains all parameters of the current model.
				Parameters are model variables that can be changed
				during a simulation process. You can change them before
				starting a simulation or when a simulation runs in real time.
				Some parameters represented by sliders (numerical parameters).
				Other parameters represented by check boxes (boolean parameters).

					</imageobject>
				</mediaobject>
			</figure>
				
				
				Each chart window shows a plot of some model variable.
				If you click the 'Clear' button, then
				the plot area will be cleared. If you click the 'Save'
				button, then you can select a file in which to save
				the numerical data of a plot.
			</para>

							fileref="images/WormsView.png" />
					</imageobject>
				</mediaobject>
			</figure>
			
			</para>
			<para>
				These windows give the additional visualizations
				of the running simulation. You can customize each view
				window and the main window view by right clicking on them
				and selecting 'Properties' from the pop-up menu. Also
				you can remove any additional view window by selecting
				'Remove view' from the same pop-up menu. 'Properties' opens
				a visualization properties dialog.
				
			<figure>
				<title>Visualization Properties dialog</title>
				<mediaobject>
					<imageobject>
						<imagedata align="left" format="PNG" width = "4in"
							fileref="images/WormsRenderParameters.png" />
					</imageobject>
				</mediaobject>
			</figure>

				
				Here you can set visualization properties of agents: they
				can be transparent, visible/invisible, with or without borders.
				Also you specify the order in which agents will be visualized.
				Agents on the top of the list are drawn atop of other agents.
				In the 'Spaces' section you can select which space is visualized
				in the given window. In the 'Data Layers' section you can select
				a data layer to be visualized.
			</para>
		</sect2>
	

		<sect2>
			<title>Dataset window</title>
			<para>
				It is possible to save the data collected during the simulation. Just
				click the Save button in the Dataset window.
				
				<figure>
				<title>Dataset window</title>
				<mediaobject>
					<imageobject>
						<imagedata align="left" format="PNG" width = "2in"
							fileref="images/WormsDataset.png" />
					</imageobject>
				</mediaobject>
				</figure>
				
				The standard dialog will appear where you can specify the name of a 
				data file. All data will be saved as a plain text CSV file which can be
				easily opened in Microsoft Excel. Note that the saved data
				will also contain the current values of all parameters.			
			</para>
			<para>
				Sometime it is required to run a model several times and save the
				results after each run. To simplify this procedure, you can use
				batch run feature of SPARK. Go to Options menu and click Batch Run Parameters.
				
				<figure>
					<title>Batchrun Dialog</title>
					<mediaobject>
						<imageobject>
							<imagedata align="left" format="PNG" width = "2in"
								fileref="images/BatchrunDialog.png" />
							</imageobject>
					</mediaobject>
				</figure>
				
				The first line in the batch run dialog is the number of steps (ticks)
				in each run. The second line is the number of runs. And the third line
				is the [name of file] where results will be saved. Batch run works as follows:
				first you specify all parameters and click OK. Then you click Setup button
				and Start button (you may also turn off synchronization and close some windows
				for increasing simulation speed). After that the simulation will run exactly
				specified number of steps. When the maximal number of steps is reached, the
				results are automatically saved in the file named [name of file][#run].csv, where
				[name of file] is the name specified in the batch run parameters and [#run] is
				the number of the current run. After the results are saved, model is reseted
				and a new simulation starts.
